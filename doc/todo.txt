    25 Feb.:  Sequence types or blocks.
    26 Mar.:  Sequence types and blocks.
    08 Apr.:  Functions or import declarations.
    22 Apr.:  Functions and import declarations.

Other things to do:

- Better way to specify tests?
===== Change way tests are specified: make a way to test expression checking,
and find better naming scheme for one_liners, since we're not considering
expression statements.
