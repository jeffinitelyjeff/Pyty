Main Goals:

    11 Feb.:  Include the float type.
    25 Feb.:  Sequence types or blocks.
    26 Mar.:  Sequence types and blocks.
    08 Apr.:  Functions or import declarations.
    22 Apr.:  Functions and import declarations.

Other things to do:

- make parser only add environment info if the docstring comes before the
  variable's first position in the text
- do check_For_stmt, but this isn't possible until we have sequence types
- make pytytypes better -> have class which just has an enumerated type for
  basetypes, make things abstracted better.
- rewrite assertions into typecheck -- should through debugging output when
  getting to weird branches instead of just returning false.

- add ability to specify a type in one line like this: "x = 5 #: x : int" make
- more efficient AST traversal when adding typedec nodes -> shouldn't have to
  start at the root every time.

- implement more efficient storage of environments; instead of storing the
  entire environment at each statement node, just store references to the
  previous dictionaries.

- allow multiple variables to be typedec'd in one statement (this is implemented
  from the AST side, but not the parsing side.)

- look into ast.get_docstring --> possibly could be modified to also give
  variable docstring?

- enable setting of list values in an assignment
