Main Goals:

    11 Feb.:  Include the float type.
    25 Feb.:  Sequence types or blocks.
    26 Mar.:  Sequence types and blocks.
    08 Apr.:  Functions or import declarations.
    22 Apr.:  Functions and import declarations.

Other things to do:

- make parser only add environment info if the docstring comes before the
  variable's first position in the text
- do check_For_stmt, but this isn't possible until we have sequence types
