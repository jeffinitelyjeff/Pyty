==========
Looked more into how assignments are managed in an AST. Started trying to
generate a list of all variables assigned values, so I can eventually use that
list to look in the docstrings to gather type information to check against.
Docstrings that aren't available from the AST module shouldn't be hard to find,
since I'll have access to line numbers. Not at a stage to test yet, still trying
to get basic functions running (after which I'll make tests). Having lots of
trouble parsing files in other directories: Python keeps throwing
"AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'suite" from code in the
compiler class.


Things to talk about for 10-22
==============================
-Issues with compiler.parseFile() and paths <-- looks like it's not about paths, it just doesn't work AT ALL when in the src/ directory?
