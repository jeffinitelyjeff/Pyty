+ should all children of a block statement be treated as sharing the same
  environment? this would be easier to implement. for now I'll assume I
  shouldn't do it this way. <-- ANSWER: no, they shouldn't.



- should y = 4 = 3.0 + x fail to typecheck or throw an error if y has been
  specified as an int?
- including assert statements under class variable declarations seems bad;
  should this be avoided?
