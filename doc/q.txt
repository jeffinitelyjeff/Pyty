+ should all children of a block statement be treated as sharing the same
  environment? this would be easier to implement. for now I'll assume I
  shouldn't do it this way. <-- ANSWER: no, they shouldn't.



- should y = 4 = 3.0 + x fail to typecheck or throw an error if y has been
  specified as an int? <-- ANSWER: there should be lots of different kinds of
  errors; there's no real "right" way to fail.
- including assert statements under class variable declarations seems bad;
  should this be avoided? <-- ANSWER: this is good practice.
- I really like the idea of adding the is\_simple, is\_compound, etc. methods to
  the ast.stmt class, but where is the best place to do this? my first thought
  was that it should be before those methods are used (ie, it would be added in
  the initialization of a TypeDecASTModule, since it's in placing typedecs that
  these methods are first used), but it doesn't seem appropriate to insert them
  here since it's doing a module-wide change. would the best place for it be
  under the import statements of the ast module? <-- ANSWER: meh, whatever.
