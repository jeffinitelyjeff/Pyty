Pyty is a static typechecker for Python source code. Like
[pylint](http://www.logilab.org/857) and
[PyChecker](http://pychecker.sourceforge.net/), it is a tool which is run on
Python source code to catch problems found at the compiling stage in
less-dynamic languages, though Pyty requires annotating code with type
declarations similar to those found in static-typed languages. While static
typing is a very unpythonic concept, there is a demand for _optional_ static
typing in Python, and Guido himself has
[heavily considered the issue](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=85551).

Pyty is currently at a very rudimentary stage.
