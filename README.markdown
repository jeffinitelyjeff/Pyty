Pyty is a static typechecker for Python source code. Like
[pylint](http://www.logilab.org/857) and
[PyChecker](http://pychecker.sourceforge.net/), Pyty is a tool run on source
code to catch the compile-time errors of less-dynamic languages. Pyty is meant
to be used in instances when the _security_ of ensuring valid logic is more
important than the _flexibility_ of Python's dynamic-typing fetaures.

Pyty is currently at a very rudimentary stage, and is being developed by Jeff
Ruberg as a senior thesis project at Wesleyan University.
